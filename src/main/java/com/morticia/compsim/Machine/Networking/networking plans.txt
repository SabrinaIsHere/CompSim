This is a document to plan out certain protocols for networking. I'm not very experienced with networking
so this is going to be less based in real life systems than, say, the io. If you think I should change
anything about this I'm open to suggestions

std:
Get Network Machine -
    Return a packet with the address of the network administrator machine. If one exists it will generally
    provide general information about the network and the networks it connects to through a database
    implementation

Ping -
    Machines returns a packet with the word 'pong'. Primarily to check if the machine exists

database:
Sign In -
    Has the database register the sender ip as possessing certain credentials. Not always a necessary step
    as data can be available to anonymous users as well

Query -
    Only applies if the machine has a database implementation. Sends a packet asking for some information,
    gets a response with the requested information if it's credentials are good.

remote_terminal:
Open -
    This opens a terminal and attempts to open a socket with the given machine. Once the socket is opened
    the sender will send commands along the socket and the receiving machine will get them and send back
    output.

Close -
    This attempts to close a remote terminal session. It closes the socket and prints a message signaling
    termination.

email:
Send -
    Used to send emails to the owner of this machine. This application will be functional but it will mostly be
    used to convey story information
