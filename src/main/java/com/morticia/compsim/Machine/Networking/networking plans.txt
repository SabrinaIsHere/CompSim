This is a document to plan out certain protocols for networking. I'm not very experienced with networking
so this is going to be less based in real life systems than, say, the io. If you think I should change
anything about this I'm open to suggestions

Get Network Machine -
    Return a packet with the address of the network administrator machine. If one exists it will generally
    provide general information about the network and the networks it connects to through a database
    implementation

Query -
    Only applies if the machine has a database implementation. Sends a packet asking for some information,
    gets a response with the requested information if it's credentials are good.

Remote Terminal -
    This opens a terminal and attempts to open a socket with the given machine. Once the socket is opened
    the sender will send commands along the socket and the receiving machine will get them and send back
    output.
