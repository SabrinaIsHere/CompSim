Packages will be implemented exclusively in lua

On boot the os will look in the .cfg/start.cfg for a list of scripts to execute on startup. These will be registered
by packages on installation if they need to be executed on boot. Packages will have a couple set files the os will
look for at routine points during runtime and installation.

There will be a registry where packages will be able to register themselves for receiving networking events, like
packets and socket requests. They will also be able to add their folders to the path and thereby add commands to the
system.

Defined packages like this makes it easier for people to exchange custom software by giving it a rigid and copyable
format baked into the game anyway. The game is also meant to be a bit of a sandbox where people can make their own
stuff beyond the campaign I make, this is all scaffolding for later work.
